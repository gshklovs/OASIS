Hello, this is my new notepad. I will be typing out my ideas in this doc. I finished alex hormozis book.

He taught to price high by providing an obscene anount of value through a unqie bproduct. With garuntees, you assure a high likelyhood of success. What is value?

# Value

**Defenition of value:** A measurment for problem solving ability

- Something that has high value can solve a lot of problems, can solve a big problem, solve problems fast,

- google def: one's judgement of what is important in life

### Value: measurement of ability to help reach ones desires

help: faster speed, less effort, less resources

## Which of our efffrots create value and which are wasteful?

1. Creating a porototype that I can put in front of people for feedback
2. Asking people which parts about shopping they struggle with
3. "Mock servicing" customers in order to see if my service actually works

   - By doing so, I can find all ther problems with my offer and create solutions for them (Alex Hormozi style) -- an offer so good that they feel stupid saying no

### To Do: Go to a shopping center and offer my service to people (maybe for free, but all for the sake of experiment) Practice selling the service and get feedback/testing material along the way (WHOA, what if I tried this in truckee)
